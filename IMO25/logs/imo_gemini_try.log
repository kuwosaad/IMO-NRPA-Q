We first establish a lower bound on the total number of lines required to cover all points $(a,b)$ with $a+b \le n+1$.  We suspect this minimum number is close to $n$ and achievable with mostly non-sunny lines. We then analyze how many points can lie on a single sunny line.  A key insight will be that perturbing the points slightly doesn't change the covering number significantly, but it can break degeneracies where multiple points lie on a single sunny line.  This suggests a strategy o
