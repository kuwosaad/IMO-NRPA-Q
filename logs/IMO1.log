   |T| = n(n+1)/2.  

2.  Forbidden directions  
   A line is **not sunny** iff it is parallel to x=0, y=0, or x+y=0.  
   Hence every non-sunny line is of the form  
   x = c,  y = c,  or  x+y = c  (c ∈ ℤ).  

3.  Count how many of these lines hit T  
   - x = c : 1 ≤ c ≤ n  
   - y = c : 1 ≤ c ≤ n  
   - x+y = c : 3 ≤ c ≤ n+1  
   Total non-sunny lines that can cover points of T: 3n–2.

The triangular lattice T = {(a,b) : a,b ≥ 1, a+b ≤ n+1} has N = n(n+1)/2 points.  
Non-sunny lines are only the three directions x = c, y = c, x+y = c.  
Step 1 – saturate with non-sunny lines: take every vertical, horizontal and anti-diagonal that meets T; this gives ≤ 3n lines and covers every point.  
Step 2 – prune overlaps: any two non-sunny lines of different directions intersect in at most one lattice point, so the total number of incidences is ≤ 3n·n = 3n².

The required lattice points form the triangle T with vertices (1,1), (1,n), (n,1).  
Step 1:  Observe that the only non-sunny lines that can cover more than one point of T are  
x = c, y = c, x + y = c (c integer).  There are exactly 3n–3 such lines that meet T.  
Step 2:  Any other line (i.e. a sunny line) meets T in at most one lattice point.  
Hence to cover the remaining |T| – (3n–3) points we need at least  
k ≥ |T| – (3n–3) = n(n+1)/2 – (3n–3).

**Approach:**  
We first note that the required lattice points form a triangular grid \( T = \{(a,b) \mid a,b \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}, a+b \leq n+1\} \). The non-sunny lines are exactly those parallel to \( x=0 \), \( y=0 \), or \( x+y=0 \). The extremal configuration is the union of:  
1. All vertical lines \( x = a \) for \( 1 \leq a \leq n \),  
2. All horizontal lines \( y = b \) for \( 1 \leq b \leq n \),  
3. The diagonal line \( x+y = n+1 \).

1.  The required lattice points form a right-triangle of size  
   T = {(a,b) | a,b≥1, a+b≤n+1}; |T| = n(n+1)/2.  
2.  Non-sunny lines are exactly the vertical x=c, horizontal y=c, and anti-diagonal x+y=c.  
   Each such line hits at most n points of T, so at least  
   ⌈|T|/n⌉ = ⌈(n+1)/2⌉ non-sunny lines are necessary for coverage.  
3.  We therefore start with the maximal non-sunny covering set  
   L₀ = {x=1,…,x=n} ∪ {y=1,…,y=n} ∪ {x+y=2,…,x+y=n+1}.  
   |L₀| = 3n–2, but many points

The triangular lattice  
T = {(a,b) : a,b ∈ ℤ>0, a+b ≤ n+1}  
has |T| = n(n+1)/2 points.  
Each non-sunny line (axis-parallel or slope –1) meets T in at most n points, while a sunny line meets T in at most n–1 points (because it misses the three forbidden directions).  
We need an (n-line) cover of T.  
Let k be the number of sunny lines and n–k the number of non-sunny lines.  
A simple double-counting of incidences gives  
|T| ≤ k(n–1) + (n–k)n = n² – k.  
Hence k ≤ n² –

1.  The required lattice points form a right-triangle grid  
   Tₙ = {(a,b)∈ℤ² : 1≤a, 1≤b, a+b≤n+1}.  
   |Tₙ| = n(n+1)/2.  
2.  Non-sunny lines are exactly the three families  
   x=c, y=c, x+y=c.  Each family covers at most n points of Tₙ, so the union of all non-sunny lines covers ≤3n points.  
3.  Because 3n < n(n+1)/2 for n≥3, at least one sunny line is forced; hence k≥1.  
4.  Conversely, take the full set of non-sunny lines that hit Tₙ (there are 3n–3 of them) and delete the redu
