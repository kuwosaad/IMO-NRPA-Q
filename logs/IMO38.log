[2025-08-22 15:31:44] [NRPA] Running strategic simulation for path: Double Counting: Count incidences between lines and grid points to derive inequality relating n and k - systematically addresses coverage constraints and intersection overcounting -> Define incidence matrix: Let I = sum_{point p} (lines through p) = sum_{line L} (points on L). Apply Cauchy-Schwarz to both sums. -> Define incidence indicator: I(p,L)=1 if p∈L, else 0. Then I = ∑_p ∑_L I(p,L) = ∑_L ∑_p I(p,L). Apply Cauchy: (∑_p (∑_L I(p,L))² ≥ (∑_p ∑_L I(p,L))² / n². -> Refine Cauchy-Schwarz: Apply to line sum: (∑_L (∑_p I(p,L))²) ≥ (∑_L ∑_p I(p,L))² / k. This gives a second inequality relating total incidences.
