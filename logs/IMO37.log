The grid has T = (n+1)(n+2)/2 points. Each line covers at most n+1 points. Thus, at least ceil(T/(n+1)) = ceil((n+2)/2) lines are needed. But we have exactly n lines. For n\u22653, we show k can be any integer from 0 to n except n-1. Construction: Use all axis-parallel and anti-diagonals? Actually, careful: non-sunny lines are those parallel to x-axis, y-axis, or x+y=0. So sunny lines are all others. Key: Covering condition forces many lines to be non-sunny. Maximum k is n (all sunny) but impossible due to covering? Actually, all sunny is possible? But then must cover points like (1,1) etc. Actually, we prove k \u2260 n-1. Constructions: k=0: use lines x=1,2,...,n and y=1,2,...,n? But then n+n=2n lines, too many. So must combine. Actually, use lines: x=1, x=2, ..., x=n, and y=1, y=2, ..., y=n? That gives 2n lines, but we only have n. So need smarter: For k=0, use lines parallel to axes and x+y=0. For example, for n=3: lines x=1, y=1, x+y=4? But then (2,2) not covered? Actually, we need to cover all (a,b) with a+b\u22644. So points: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3); (2,1), (2,2); (3,1). So lines: x=1 covers (1,1),(1,2),(1,3); x=2 covers (2,1),(2,2); x=3 covers (3,1); and also need to cover? Actually, x=2 covers (2,1) and (2,2); but (1,1) is covered by x=1? But then we have 3 lines: x=1, x=2, x=3. But these are all non-sunny (parallel to y-axis). And they cover all points? (1,1), (1,2), (1,3); (2,1), (2,2); (3,1). So for n=3, k=0 works with lines x=1, x=2, x=3. Similarly, for general n, k=0: use lines x=1, x=2, ..., x=n. These are all non-sunny (parallel to y-axis). They cover all points (a,b) with a+b\u2264n+1? For a fixed a, points (a,b) with b\u22651 and a+b\u2264n+1, so b=1,..., n+1-a. So line x=a covers these. So indeed covered. So k=0 works. Similarly, k=n: all lines sunny. Construction? For n=3, need 3 sunny lines covering all points. For example, lines: y=x+2, y=-x+4, y=2x? Check: (1,1): on y=x+2? 1=1+2? No. On y=-x+4: 1=-1+4=3? No. On y=2x: 1=2? No. So not covered. Actually, it's tricky. But we can construct: For n, use lines with slopes not 0, \u221e, -1. Actually, known result: k can be 0,1,...,n except n-1. So we need to show k=n-1 is impossible. Proof: Suppose exactly one line is non-sunny. That line is parallel to x-axis, y-axis, or x+y=0. It covers at most n+1 points. The other n-1 sunny lines: each sunny line has slope not 0, \u221e, -1. How many points can a sunny line cover? At most n? Actually, consider line with slope m \u2260 0,\u221e,-1. It intersects the grid? Maximum points? But careful: The points are (a,b) with a,b positive integers and a+b\u2264n+1. So the grid is triangular. A line can cover at most floor((n+1)/d) points? Actually, it's not trivial. But the key is that the total coverage is bounded. The non-sunny line covers at most n+1 points. Each sunny line covers at most n points? But actually, for n=4, a sunny line might cover 4 points? For example, line y=x+1 through (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)? But 3+4=7>5? Actually, a+b\u22645 for n=4? So (3,4) has 7>5, not included. So maximum for sunny line is actually n? For n=4, maximum is 4? Example: line y=x through (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)? But 3+3=6>5? So only (1,1) and (2,2)? Actually, (1,1):2\u22645, (2,2):4",
