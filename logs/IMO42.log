[2025-08-30 04:09:56] [NRPA] DEBUG: Generated sketch (first 500 chars): {"sketch": "We consider the set P = {(a,b): a,b positive integers, a+b ≤ n+1} with |P| = n(n+1)/2. We have n lines covering these points. Apply Szemerédi–Trotter: I(P,L) ≤ 2.5 |P|^{2/3} |L|^{2/3} + |P| + |L|. But here I(P,L) ≥ |P| since every point is covered. This gives n(n+1)/2 ≤ 2.5 (n(n+1)/2)^{2/3} n^{2/3} + n(n+1)/2 + n. For large n, this forces many incidences per line. Alternatively, use crossing number: if many lines are non-sunny (axis-parallel or slope -1), they have limited directions
